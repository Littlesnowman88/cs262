Hi Lydia.
default_state.png is what the app looks like upon creation.
counter_incremented.png is what the app looks like upon pressing
	the counter button 5 times.
showing_toast.png is what the app looks like after pressing the
	Hello Toast! button.
I worked on this lab with Kelsey Brouwer and Theron Tjapkes.
	Dr. VanderLinden approved us working on it as a group of 3,
	and Kelsey had been developing it on a local copy.
