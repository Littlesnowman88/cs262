Exercise 6.1 answers:
Task1:
A) What Android template automatically adds a settings menu item?
	--basic activity template
B)What is the difference between task 1 and task 2?
	--task 1 builds a basic settings activity from scratch, with a single toggle-setting.
	--task 2 uses Android Studio's settings activity template to create a multi-screen
		settings UI. Settings are divided into groups in task 2.

Task2:
A) What are you testing/demonstrating when you re-run the application on a device with a larger screen?
	--Essentially, I would be testing that Android shows fragments side-by-side, instead
		showing things on different screens.
B) The settings activity template must build fragments for you. Where are they defined?
	--The settings's fragments are programatically defined and added from within
		SettingsActivity.java. SettingsActivity.Java has "public static class"es
		for its Fragments.

//NOTE TO GRADER: The up arrow does not return Settings Activity to Main Activity. I checked
	the solution code and my relevant up-button function (onOptionsItemSelected) matches
	the solutin code. I may try to spend time fixing it, but the Android back arrow 
	(the one at the bottom of the screen) will return the user to the Main Activity.
