Documentation changes for homework1 and homework2

Homework1: Calculator app
added a root layout comment in main activity layout
Otherwise, I already commented my xml.
I had already commented much of MainActivity; even so, I turned function header comments into proper javadoc comments.
I also fixed a logic error. For selecting operators, if no operators exist, the operator will now be an empty string
	instead of an index error (fix location: onNothingSelected)

Homework2: Fetching Player Data from a monopoly database.
Updated comments to xml layout and menu; labeled UI elements.
Added javadoc to all functions of all 6 Java classes in homework2
Ran android's auto-formatting, too.
In MainActivity.java, added in-function comments to highlight various code sections.
In MainActivity.fetchPlayer(), deleted a commented out line of code.
In MainActivity helper functions (private functions at bottom, I added in-function comments to highlight code objectives.

Homework3: No code was submitted, so no documentation requirements can be met.
